# Email classification based on Bayesian analysis
Group Members: Yuhuan Ma, XXX and XXX
### Introduction
Spam email, or junk email, refers to unsolicited messages sent in bulk. This notorious email threat got its name from Spam lunch meat, which has a reputation of being ubiquitous, repetitive and unavoidable. If you have an email account, we are sure that you have seen emails being categorised into different buckets and automatically being marked important, spam, promotions, etc. It's wonderful to see machines being so smart and doing the work for us.
### Data Collection
we will collect datasets from open source Eg. https://github.com/shijing888/BayesSpam https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/.
### Method
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem used for email spam filtering in data analytics.
